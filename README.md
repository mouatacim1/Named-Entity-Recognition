NER stands for Names entity Recognition, which is an information extraction technique to identify and classify named entities in a text.

The aim of this project is to build a machine learning algorithm using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and more specifically, using Long Short Term Memory Neural Networks (LSTM) which are an advanced version of classic RNNs.
RNNs are the kind of networks with loops in them, which means they can keep some information in order to use it in the next step but they cannot keep it when it comes to a long sequence of data while LSTM networks can learn long-term dependencies.

The ipynb file contains all the steps to build NER algorithm using LSTM networks, from data pre-processing to testing, using some performance metrics.
